# Sub1-Ghz-RF-Data-TX-RX
## Project Summary
This sub project is part of a bigger "IoT remote temperature sensors" project developed by [Marc Farssac](https://github.com/marcfarssac). It shows how to use a ultra low power Sub-1 GHz Radiofrequency Wireless (WiFi) communication between two electronic modules using a center frequency of 868.0 Mhz using the 48-MHz Arm Cortex-M3 microcontrollers to share information between two nodes.
